      <h1>Hey, I'm Shaaf 👋</h1>
      <br />
      <p>
        I'm a second-year Computer Engineering student 💻🎓 at Toronto
        Metropolitan University, deeply passionate about the vast fields of web
        development 🌐, AI 🧠, and machine learning 📊
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        When I'm not at the computer, I'm either dozing off 😴 amidst a sea of
        circuits during ELE lectures, or intently focused on subjects that
        ignite my curiosity and drive my passion for technology 🔥💡
      </p>
