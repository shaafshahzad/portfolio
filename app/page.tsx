      <h1>Hey, I'm Shaaf! 👋😄</h1>
      <br />
      <p>
        I'm a second-year Computer Engineering student 💻🎓 at Toronto
        Metropolitan University, deeply passionate about the vast fields of web
        development 🌐, AI 🧠, and machine learning 📊

      <p>
        When I'm not at the computer, I'm either dozing off 😴 amidst a sea of
        circuits during ELE lectures ⚡, or eagerly expanding my knowledge and
        exploring new insights that benefit and fuel my passion for technology
        🔥💡
